# Vouch SSO Addon

The Vouch Addon allows the use of Home Assistant's built in authentication and Single Sign On functionality to be used by other applications such as extra entries in the [Nginx Proxy Manager Addon](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-nginx-proxy-manager).

See the documentation tab for more information and installation instructions.
